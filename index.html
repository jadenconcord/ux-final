                <p class="first-big">For many <b class="larger"></b>Task Management</b> is a challenging task. Though
                    the concept of <b class="larger">Task Management</b> is quite simple, the <b
                        class="larger">effectiveness</b> of keeping
                    track of <b class="larger">tasks</b> is sometimes ineffective through various software methods.
                    Through <b class="larger">analysis</b>, <b class="larger"></b>research</b> and <b
                        class="larger">experiments</b> of <b class="larger">Task Management</b> I have found the <b
                        class="larger">optimal</b> software <b class="larger">solution</b> for Task Management.</b></p>
                <p>Three aspects of the optimal task management application are researched. Firstly, the flow of managing
                    tasks. This includes the framework for how tasks are displayed, calculated and handled. Secondly,
                    the layout of the application including the header, sidebar and content position and necessity.
                    Lastly, the navigation of the site's header links.</p>

            <h2>Why a New Task Management System?</h2>
            <p>Personally, I have never used task management system that has been effective enough for me to fully
                implement. I have noticed may flaws in current task management software and written methods where I have
                found the optimal method that should be used. To stand out from competitors, the new system focuses on
                simplicity while still having the functional features to be successful.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box" id="purpose">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The project I am focusing on could effect how I keep track of and manage tasks. I am invested in this
                project because I
                want to find the best method for task management. I currently do not have the best task management
                system, so this
                project allows me to create or use a better task management system.</p>

            <h3>Joe - Student</h3>
            <p>Joe is a high school student who is involved in various clubs and extracurricular activities. Joe
                struggles to keep track of tasks and events for his school and activities. He is good at remembering
                projects and tasks he needs to get done, but because of this, he has problems turning in things on time
                and not forgetting things.</p>
            <h3>Sally - Manager</h3>
            <p>Sally is a experienced manager in a corporate environment. She has moved up in her position through her
                hard work and motivation. She is very productive and makes sure to keep track of things, however she is
                not the best at working efficiently. She also finds using technology challenging, preferring to use
                written methods to keep track of things, however this comes as a disadvantage to her at times.</p>
            <h3>Matt - Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>Matt is a junior software Engineer at a corporate software company. Matt is good at his job, but finds
                focusing on his work challenging. He easily gets destructed and easily forgets events and projects that
                need to be done. He is very busy with projects and often has very little time to do other things
                besides work. He uses task management but finds that he forgets reminders after he sees them sometimes.

                <p>Based on the results, I have reached the conclusion that for best user experience, there should be
                    only an Account menu which includes account settings and general settings. I will keep minimal
                    features on the product which excludes the need for a Main Menu.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>The first frame was made out of the results from the layout experiments which showed me the following
                information</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using the sidebar is the most efficient and easy to learn layout</li>
                <li>Using a dropdown box is the most challenging item for certain users to understand</li>
                <li>Dropdown boxes should be expanded by default to prevent confusion in not understanding opening them
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the header, I also had the card sort which revealed that I should combine the settings and account
                together.</p>
            <img width="100%" src="img/frame-1.png">
            <p>In the next iteration, I did research on task management, and integrated its functionality into the
                wireframes (shown to the right)</p>
            <p>From looking at the card sort, I was also able to use 4 items on the menu which are Upgrade, Preferences,
                Account Settings, and help. The upgrade section was added as the call to action.</p>
            <p>In addition to these, I added catagories because they were needed from the personas and needs of general
                users.</p>
            <img width="100%" src="img/frame-2.png">
            <p>The next iteration added a basic theme to the app which made it easier to understand the functionality
                of the app. I also filled in placeholder text and added the sharing options, again because of the needs
                shown in the personas and research.</p>
            <img width="100%" src="img/frame-3.png">
            <p>The last iteration outlines and identifies the functionality of the app. Note: the logo icon on the top
                left is a placeholder for the client's or app's logo.</p>
            <p>The last feature I needed to add was to tasks. I added options to create sub-tasks. This action was done
                to give advanced users options to have more freedom on how they organize the app. Basic functionality is
                simple, but this is an advanced feature.</p>
            <p>I also have added an assigned icon to show that a task is assigned or not. It is also toggle-able so the
                the tasks do not need to be edited in an external popup. The task names are also editable when focused.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>A concluding summary of your project that addresses how your designs improve the user experience beyond
                the current
                state and/or create business value.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of this project, I analyzed existing task management apps and then stripped the basic
                feature from them, creating a more simplified, user oriented, effective design that gives a competitive
                edge over the competitors.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>The best designers and the best programmers aren't the ones with the best skills, or the nimblest
                    fingers, or the new who can rock and roll with Photoshop or their environment of choice, they are
                    the
                    ones that can determine what just doesn't matter. That's where the real gains are made.</em>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 37signals
            </blockquote>
            <p>By recognizing that simplicity is a competitive advantage, I was able to conduct research and experiments
                that allowed me to create a more efficient task management solution. These experiments allowed me to
                find the optimal layout for the app, which turned out to include a sidebar. Using research into task
                management, I was able to add features to improve productivity in the app more than its competitors.</p>
            <p>With the competitive advantage, I was able to surface, higher conversion rates and a greater use of the
                app is to be expected through the improvements to usability. With the addition of premium features, the
                application should generate high business value with a more pleasing application.</p>

        <section class="box" id="next">
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>My next steps in this project would be to actually create the application. I would have to create a
                working application with the information I now have, do more tests and research on how it preforms, and
                then I would make changes to the application and repeat this process.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the steps that I would take:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create premium features</li>
                <li>Deploy and study user behavior to purchase things within the application</li>
                <li>Make changes with the new data collected</li>
                <li>Watch competitors and react to changes in the market or trends that should be implemented</li>
